This repository contains a simple Python example demonstrating a common syntax error: an unclosed bracket in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  This error typically results in a `SyntaxError` during compilation/interpretation. This example highlights the importance of careful code writing and the use of linters for error detection.
